* master repo for game-buzz: DBC phase 3 final project by Chris DeLauder, Chris Cooper, Betsy Rhodes and Sean Dickey

Develop team workflow agreements around git (see git workflow, deployment, testing, conflict resolution, lunch and other important items.

# Git Workflow
1. You must resolve merge conflicts locally before pushing.

2. Neither you nor your pair partner may merge a branch to master that you have been working on.

# Project flow and management
1. We will use agile practices.

2. Stand-up meetings will be held every 2 hours. We will try to limit our stand-ups to a maximum of 10 minutes.

3. We will use Trello as a visual representation of our workflow.

# Conflict resolution

We will be open and honest about our ideas, accomplishments, challenges, and frustrations, setting proper expectations in our check-ins.

# Coding, roles, time frames

1. We will attempt to TDD this entire project, opting for a more flexible approach if time becomes an issue.

2. Lunches and breaks - taken as needed, communicating clearly with the rest of the team regarding how long we will take.

3. Pairing - A majority of our work will be done in pairs. However, an individual may break off for spikes or other situations that call for it.

4. Known time frames for team members:

* Betsy - Will not be working at DBC past 10 - 10:30 pm. Wants to work on synching things, pushing simultaneous updates. Appreciates help getting things started.

* Chris - Will not be at DBC on the weekends prior to 12:00 pm. Strong at MVC/CRUD. Wants to implement and dive into new technologies.

* Cooper - Good with models/associations and db related items. Likes MVC, JS. Appreciates help getting things started.

* Sean - Good with front-end. Wants to dive deeper into JS and new techs. Appreciates honest feedback and solving problems.
